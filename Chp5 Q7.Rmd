# The step() function uses information criteria for variable selection, 
#  k = 2 (default) gives AIC, k = log(nrow(...)) gives BIC when "..." is
#  replaced with the data set name

#the final model includes distance and PAT as its 
#explanatory variables. It has a BIC of 784.2

#for each possible change to the model such as add wind as its
#explanatory variables, the BIC would increases to 788.71. 
#The table is provided here as a reference.
