                                         Degradation.low),

BirdData <- BirdData1()

#there is no level for "Degradation", we need level for it.
BirdData$Degradation <- factor(BirdData$Degradation, levels = c("High","Moderate","Low"))

#Create contingency table
GPI3 <- xtabs(formula= Count ~ Guild + Degradation, data=BirdData)

#fit with poison regression
poi.fit <- glm(Count ~ Guild*Degradation,
               family = poisson(link = "log"), data = BirdData)

#check out odds ratio based on estimated coefficient at interaction terms.
summary(poi.fit)
```
For example, at "GuildFruit:DegradationModerate". Since we are using High level degradation as a base line, we would interpret this line as: the estimate for OR is exp(-0.7087), the ratio of fruit guild is exp(-0.7087)-1 higher in Moderate level degradation then in High level degradation.

Keep this concept in mind, we can find that when we interpret -2.0149 and -0.2657, those two values represent largest and smallest odds ratios. Hence, we can conclude that fruit guild is more affected by habitat degradation, ground guild is less affected by habitat degradation.
