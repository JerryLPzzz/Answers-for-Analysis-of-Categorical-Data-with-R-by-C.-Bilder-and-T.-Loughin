#p-values from both Pearson chi-square and LR tests are very large.
#Thus, we conclude that there is no evidence against independence.
#The result found here are similar to the data analysis in Chapter 2.
#Because it is the same as tests for the equality of two binomial 
# success probabilities, which is equivalent to a test for independence 
# in a product multinomial model with I=J=2.
